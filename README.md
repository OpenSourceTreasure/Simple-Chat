Simple Chat

🥁 A very simple chat in html and javascript for you to build upon

💬 This is code for a basic chat room. It is by no means a finished product. If you are building a chat room, perhaps this will give you a basis and save a bit of time.

🎷 There are no dependencies. Just html and javascript.

🎸 Demo - https://opensourcetreasure.github.io/simple-chat/

✅ Bonus! Dual-chat.html is a dual chat on one non-scrolling page. It is to chats in 1 chat room. Users are Webchat and Webchat II. Again, you can use this to build something.

🥂 Enjoy!
