Simple Chat

🥁 A very simple chat in html and javascript for you to build upon

💬 This is code for a basic chat room. It is by no means a finished product. If you are building a chat room, perhaps this will give you a basis and save a bit of time.

🎷 There are no dependencies. Just html and javascript.
